I am a PhD-student at Computational Linguistics and Linguistic Theory ([COLT](https://www.upf.edu/web/colt)) research group, [University of Pompeu Fabra](https://www.upf.edu/) (Barcelona, Spain). With my doctoral advisor [Dr. Elia Bruni](https://eliabruni.github.io/) and [Dieuwke Hupkes](http://dieuwkehupkes.nl/), I work on the interpretability of neural language models.

Previously, I obtained my MSc. in [Brain and Cognitive Sciences](https://www.uva.nl/en/programmes/research-masters/brain-and-cognitive-sciences/brain-and-cognitive-sciences.html?origin=5BOaRAofTjCccATraJp2XA) from the [University of Amsterdam](https://www.uva.nl/en).
