I am a PhD-student at Computational Linguistics and Linguistic Theory [(COLT)](https://www.upf.edu/web/colt) research group, [University of Pompeu Fabra](https://www.upf.edu/) (Barcelona, Spain).

I work with my advisor [Dr. Elia Bruni](https://eliabruni.github.io/) and [Dieuwke Hupkes](http://dieuwkehupkes.nl/) on the interpretability of neural language models.

I obtained my MSc. in [Brain and Cognitive Sciences](https://gss.uva.nl/content/research-masters/brain-and-cognitive-sciences/brain-and-cognitive-sciences.html?1584890047348) from the [University of Amsterdam](https://www.uva.nl/en).
