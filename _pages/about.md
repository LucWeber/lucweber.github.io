I am a PhD-candidate in the [COLT](https://www.upf.edu/web/colt)-research group at [University of Pompeu Fabra](https://www.upf.edu/). With my doctoral advisors [Dr. Elia Bruni](https://eliabruni.github.io/) and [Dr. Dieuwke Hupkes](http://dieuwkehupkes.nl/), I work on understanding the learning dynamics in neural language models and how we can influence them.

Previously, I obtained my MSc. in [Brain and Cognitive Sciences](https://www.uva.nl/en/programmes/research-masters/brain-and-cognitive-sciences/brain-and-cognitive-sciences.html?origin=5BOaRAofTjCccATraJp2XA) from the [University of Amsterdam](https://www.uva.nl/en) with my thesis work conducted at [MRC-CBU in Cambridge](https://www.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk/). My BSc. in [Psychology](https://psychologie.univie.ac.at/en/) comes from the [University of Vienna](https://www.univie.ac.at/en/).
